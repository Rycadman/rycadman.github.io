		<h2> <img src="hot_dog.gif" alt="Hotdog GIF" width="30" height="90" align="center"></h2>
        <p>This is the place I will write reviews for coney island hot dogs I've had at various places in Michigan.</p>
		<h2> What is a coney island hot dog? </h2>
		<p>A coney island hot dog is a hot dog with mustard, chili, and onions. It is a staple regional food of Michigan and Detroit. I've been eating them for nearly my whole life. In fact, I used to work at a coney island restaurant in college. So I am quite the authority on coney island hot dogs.</p>
		<h2> How do you rate the hot dogs? </h2>
		<p> There are really only two factors that go into rating a coney island hot dog. How good it is, and how cheap it is. These two factors are harmonious. A cheap, good coney is ideal. An expensive good coney is okay. An expensive, bad coney is sacrilege... You get the idea here.</p>
		<p> The measure that I use for determaning what condones cheap or expensive is $3.00 </p> <p> Anything above $3.00 is expensive, anything at or below $3.00 is cheap. I understand that prices change so my reviews reflect approximately what I remember last time I was there.</p>
		<p> I will rate each coney island soley based on ordering one single coney island hot dog. I am only judging on price and if it's good. 1 is the base score, 3 is the highest score. So a cheap coney that tastes good would get 3 points. A cheap coney that's bad would get a score of 2. An expensive coney that tastes bad would get a score of 1. Etc.

		<h1> Woodward Coney Island | Score: 2</h1>
		<h3> Cheap and Bad </h3>
		<p> That isn't as bad as it sounds. It gets 1 point for being cheap. I don't know what about it made it bad, but it just didn't have much flavor.</p>
		<p> I really only went there because Lafayette Coney Island was closed while they remodelled. It's in a great location and the staff was very kind.</p>
		<hr>
		<h1> Leo's Coney Island | Score: 2</h1>
		<h3> Expensive and good </h3>
		<p> These restaurants are all over metro Detroit. The coney dogs are good but they are expensive. They are somewhat unreliable as far as ingrediants but hey, purple onions are sometimes a fun surprise! </p>
		<hr>
		<h1> Lafayette Coney Island | Score: 2 </h1>
		<h3> Expensive and good </h3>
		<p> Absolute classic! The atmosphere is the best part. These guys really know how to do the coney experiance. $4.00 for a coney island though... Wowie!</p>
		<hr>
		<h1> Cosmos Coney Island | Score: 3 </h1>
		<h3> Cheap and good </h3>
		<p> This has to be a contender for the best coney island that I've been to. Very cheap and very good. This was my favorite lunch place when I worked neraby.</p>
