        <h2 align="center">Ryan's Coney Island Reviews:</h2>
		<h2> <img src="hot_dog.gif" alt="Hotdog GIF" width="30" height="90" align="center"></h2>
        <p>This is the place I write reviews for coney island hot dogs I've had at various places in Michigan.</p>
		<h2> What is a coney island hot dog? </h2>
		<p align="left">A coney island hot dog is a hot dog with mustard, chili, and onions. It is a staple regional food of Michigan and Detroit. I've been eating them for nearly my whole life. In fact, I used to work at a coney island restaurant in college. So I am quite the authority on coney island hot dogs.</p>
		<h2> How do you rate the hot dogs? </h2>
		<p align="left"> There are really only two factors that go into rating a coney island hot dog. How good it is, and how cheap it is. These two factors are harmonious. A cheap, good coney is ideal. An expensive good coney is okay. An expensive, bad coney is sacrilege... You get the idea here.</p>
		<p align="left"> The measure that I use for determining what counts as cheap or expensive is $3.00 </p> <p align="left"> Anything above $3.00 is expensive, anything at or below $3.00 is cheap. I understand that prices change so my reviews reflect approximately what I remember last time I was there.</p>
		<p align="left"> I will rate each coney island solely based on ordering one single coney island hot dog. I am only judging on price and if it's good. 1 is the base score, 3 is the highest score. </p>
		<ul style="list-style-position: inside; text-align: center;"> <li><i>Cheap + good = 3</i></li>
		<li><i>Cheap + bad = 2</i></li>
		<li><i>Expensive + bad = 1</i></li></ul>
		<p><i>(And yes, sometimes an expensive coney can earn a 3 if it’s truly worth it.)</i></p>

		<h1><img src="new.gif" alt="new GIF" width="44" height="32"><img src="manicule.gif" alt="manicule GIF" width="64" height="24"> Duly's Place | Score: 3 </h2>
		<h3> Cheap and Good </h3>
		<p align="left"> Duly's Place, depsite being the only coney island restaurant on this page that doesn't have <i>coney island</i> in the name, just might be the best coney island hot dog that I've had. They are exclusively <b>cash only</b> and I think that's how they manage to have such good quality while remaining in the <i>cheap</i> category. I will be going back for further assessment in the near future.</p>
		<hr>
		<h1><img src="new.gif" alt="new GIF" width="44" height="32"><img src="manicule.gif" alt="manicule GIF" width="64" height="24"> Senate Coney Island | Score: 2.5 </h2>
		<h3> Expensive and Good </h3>
		<p align="left"> Senate Coney Island has great coney island hot dogs and they are <i>just barely</i> on the cusp of expensive at $3.40 per dog. I think that warrants a half point. They know not to charge $4.00 and I respect them for it.</p>
		<hr>
		<h1><img src="new.gif" alt="new GIF" width="44" height="32"><img src="manicule.gif" alt="manicule GIF" width="64" height="24"> Hollywood Coney Island | Score: 3 </h2>
		<h3> Cheap and Good </h3>
		<p align="left"> This place is another gold standard for coney island hot dogs. $1.95 coney dog... Need I say any more? That price is a true benefit to the community.</p>
		<hr>
		<h1><img src="new.gif" alt="new GIF" width="44" height="32"><img src="manicule.gif" alt="manicule GIF" width="64" height="24"> Green Dot Stables | Score: 1 </h2>
		<h3> Expensive and bad </h3>
		<p align="left"> Green Dot Stables is a very good slider restaurant, but not a very good coney island restaurant. I'm including it on this page because they do offer a coney island hot dog <i>slider.</i> It tastes very average but for $3.75 you get less of everything than you would get if it was a whole coney dog. If you ask me, It should be priced under $3.00 for what you get.</p>
		<hr>
		<h1> Woodward Coney Island | Score: 2</h1>
		<h3> Cheap and Bad </h3>
		<p align="left"> That isn't as bad as it sounds. It gets 1 point for being cheap. I don't know what about it made it bad, but it just didn't have much flavor.</p>
		<p align="left"> I really only went there because Lafayette Coney Island was closed while they remodelled. It's in a great location and the staff was very kind.</p>
		<hr>
		<h1> Leo's Coney Island | Score: 2</h1>
		<h3> Expensive and good </h3>
		<p align="left"> These restaurants are all over metro Detroit. The coney dogs are good but they are expensive. They are somewhat unreliable as far as ingredients but hey, purple onions are sometimes a fun surprise! </p>
		<hr>
		<h1> Lafayette Coney Island | Score: 3 </h1>
		<h3> Expensive and good (but worth it) </h3>
		<p align="left"> Although it is expensive, <b>it gets an extra point for actually being worth the $4.</b></p>
		<p align="left"> Absolute classic! The atmosphere is the best part. These guys really know how to do the coney experience. $4.00 for a coney island though... Wowie!</p>
		<hr>
		<h1> Cosmos Coney Island | Score: 3 </h1>
		<h3> Cheap and good </h3>
		<p align="left"> This has to be a contender for the best coney island that I've been to. Very cheap and very good. This was my favorite lunch place when I worked nearby.</p>
